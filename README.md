# A natural language date parser
I've always hated every date-picker out there... until I used Superhuman, who has a natural language date parser. I wanted that on [Merittian](https://www.merittian.com), so [I asked them on Twitter to open source it](https://twitter.com/holgerthorup/status/1148960239754076161).

But I also decided to hack something together. It's not pretty, but it works. So, I thought I'd share. 

It's not a package you can install, but you can copy/past/modify away all you want. I am 100% sure it can be improved, and one day I will (unless superhuman open source theirs before then).
